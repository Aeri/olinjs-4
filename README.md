## Recapping what we've done

## CSS

CSS is what makes websites look pretty.  It's the difference between this:

[style](https://github.com/olinjs/olinjs-4/blob/master/twitter_tyle.png?raw=true)

and this:

[no_style](https://github.com/olinjs/olinjs-4/blob/master/twitter_no_style.png?raw=true)

For these two websites the html is the same, the Javascript running on the browser is the same, everything which went on on the server side to render this page is the same. The only difference is that one is completely lacking css styling.
